#Lab 4

I found a grammatical error on Chapter 6 Section 2 in the FreeBSD handbook. It was simply a misuse of a hyphen in the word "lightweight". It is important to maintain good documentation because if there are errors, no matter how big or small, not only does it show a sign of unprofessionalism, it may also cause problems in understanding the meaning of certain words or phrases. I learned not only how to fix these type of errors in documentation, but also a better understanding of why it is important to check your work, especially concerning coding.
