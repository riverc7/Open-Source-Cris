2) It is important to choose a license so that people cannot abuse the four freedoms for free software. In other words, in order to prevent some other user from claiming that something you worked hard on is theirs and attempt to make others pay for the intentionally free software. 

3) They shouldn't use a project that doesn't have an explicit license because if they don't, they are leaving them susceptible to the whims of the projects developer. For instance, the developer could possibly have the option to add "user agreements" to the software that would make using the software a problem for the user. 

4) I definitely agree with the idea that the Web beat out the Gopher system. The WWW is just a lot more visually appealling and easier-to-access then Gopherspace. The benefit of hypertext and hyperlinks also makes the Web all that more easier to access and overall just more popular than Gopher. 

5) I think that Android chose the Apache License 2.0 in order to allow freedom of modification and distribution for their products. By choosing Apache, Android is able to work with Google in order to keep their software open-source, and be able to publicize their products whenever they up date them. 

6)I think that if I were to begin working on a project, I would want to use the MIT Licese, so that if the need were to arise, I could have others come on more easily and make changes, preferablly for the betterment of the project itself. It would honestly depend on how private or protected the project would have to be. 

7) Common Good - Apache - Allows the program/code to be open source, and usable by anyone without much fear of legal action.
Company - GPL - Has tight restrictions and forces source code to be under the same license, good for keeping a company's work all under the same license while getting the best protection.
Developer - LGPL - Is almost as tight as GPL, but essentially allows the developer to simply link outside sources instead of having to get them under the same license.
